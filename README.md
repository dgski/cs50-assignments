# Harvard CS50 - Assignments
A collection of assignments done as part of the CS50 course. The C assignments are implemented without the CS50 library.

### Problem Set 1
* **Hello** - Self-explanatory "Hello World" program.
* **Water** - Simple input/output program that calculates equivalent water bottles used during shower X minutes long.
* **Mario** - Generates end-of-level Mario pyramids using loops.
* **Credit** - Given a number, determines whether input is a valid credit card number (using Lugn's algorithm) and it's type.

### Problem Set 2
* **Initials** -  Given the input of a name, program prints out the corresponding initials.
* **Vigenere** - Takes a commandline argument as a key and then encrypts an input using the Vigenere cypher.
* **Crack** - Incredibly rudimentary 4 alpha character password cracker which simply genetates passwords and compares hashes.

### Problem Set 3
* **Find** -  Implements Counting Sort and Binary Search to find a given value in an array.
* **Fifteen** - Implements the [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

### Problem Set 4
* **Whodunit** - Iterates over a bitmap file, changes all red pixels to white ones, in order to discover the hidden message.
* **Resize** - Takes an input bitmap, and a float as a parameters, and creates a new bitmap scaled in dimensions by the float value.
* **Recover** - Can look over a raw binary dump of data, finding and extracting block-aligned jpeg images. Used for recovery.

### Problem Set 5
* **Speller** - Implements a spell checking program. Two versions: chained hash table, and trie.
